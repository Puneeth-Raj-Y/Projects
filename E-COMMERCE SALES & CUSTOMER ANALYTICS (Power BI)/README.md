# 📊 Olist E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI + Python)

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset to uncover sales performance, customer distribution, and category trends through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The project follows a **real analytics workflow**:  
- **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning, integration, and transformation  
- **Power BI** for visualization and business insights  

This is not a random dashboard — it is built to support decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Python (Pandas)** — Data preprocessing and table integration  
- **Power BI** — Interactive dashboard and business reporting  
- **CSV Dataset** — Olist Public E-commerce Dataset (Kaggle)

## 🔧 Data Preparation (What I Actually Did)
Using Python, I:
- Loaded 6 raw Olist tables  
- Merged them into a single analytics-ready dataset (`olist_cleaned.csv`)  
- Standardized data types and removed inconsistencies  
- Exported a clean dataset for Power BI analysis

## 📈 Dashboard Visuals  

The Power BI dashboard contains:

### ✅ KPI Cards (Top Row)
- **Total Revenue**  
- **Total Orders**  
- **Total Customers**  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**  

These give a high-level business snapshot.

### 📉 Line Chart — *Revenue Trend Over Time*

### 📊 Bar Chart — *Revenue by Product Category*  
Identifies which product categories drive the most revenue.

### 📋 Table — *Top 10 States by Revenue*  
Ranks customer states based on total revenue contribution.

### 🎯 Slicers (Interactive Filters)
Users can filter the dashboard using:
- Order Date  
- Product Category  
- Customer State  

All visuals update dynamically based on selections.
